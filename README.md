# Storybook :notebook:

The Flutter Romania Meetup CookBook

All pull request and contributions are welcomed and we hope on getting better and strive to learn others.


## How to run :computer:
Git clone the project and run the following commands:
1) flutter pub get;
2) flutter run -t widgetbook/main.dart;


## Contribution guides :smirk:
1) Before a pull request every branch has to have a liniar history (rebase before merge-ing);
2) Before a pull request you need to get an approve from at least one responsible person;
3) All new categories/folders/widgets should have good docs, not just docs.
4) Don't submit a pull request if "there still is a tiny thing left to do"
5) Strive to get better;
6) DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle is enforced! If we use something more than 3 times it needs to become a separate widget;
7) Every new widget should be Material 2,3 compatible;
8) Be eco devs and gather the "garbage" even if it is not yours. Optimize and improve when and where you can.
